God being the existent, the whole, what is and what will be in the entirety of the existent,
I don't need to believe in it because I exist and I'm an integral part of the existent,
the existent being self-evident, it's absurd to ask whether I believe that God exists or not.
So God is multiple through the multiplicity of all totality contains,
and this is how we speak of God's omnipresence.
